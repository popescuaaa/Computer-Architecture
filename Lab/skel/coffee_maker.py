""" 
Implement the coffee maker's commands. Interact with the user via stdin and print to stdout.

Requirements:
    - use functions
    - use __main__ code block
    - access and modify dicts and/or lists
    - use at least once some string formatting (e.g. functions such as strip(), lower(), 
    format()) and types of printing (e.g. "%s %s" % tuple(["a", "b"]) prints "a b"
    - BONUS: read the coffee recipes from a file, put the file-handling code in another module 
    and import it (see the recipes/ folder)
    
There's a section in the lab with syntax and examples for each requirement.

Feel free to define more commands, other coffee types, more resources if you'd like and have time.
"""

"""
Tips:
*  Start by showing a message to the user to enter a command, remove our initial messages
*  Keep types of available coffees in a data structure such as a list or dict
e.g. a dict with coffee name as a key and another dict with resource mappings (resource:percent) 
as value
